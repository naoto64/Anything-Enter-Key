# Anything-Enter-Key

## Overview
![Circuit](https://github.com/naoto64/Anything-Enter-Key/blob/master/enter-key-circuit.png)
This is an Arduino sketch that uses Digispark to create a touch-sensitive Enter key.
Wiring is easy, just connect a 1M ohm resistor to pins 0 and 2 and a 0.1Î¼F capacitor in series with pin 2.
Connect a non-insulator (metal, fruit, etc.) to the end of the capacitor (this is the touch sensor).
Then connect Digispark to your computer via USB. When you touch the touch sensor, it acts as an enter key.
