# Anything-Enter-Key

## Overview
This is an Arduino sketch that uses Digispark to create a touch-sensitive Enter key.
Wiring is easy, just connect a 1M ohm resistor to pins 0 and 2 and a 0.1Î¼F capacitor in series with pin 2. Connect a non-insulator (metal, fruit, etc.) to the end of the capacitor (this is the touch sensor).
